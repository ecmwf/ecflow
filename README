* dependencies

   - PYTHON_API:
     python 2.7,  Python 3.0  
     If you intend to use ecFlow Python api, You will need to install python.
     The python installation should include the development packages
     
   - ecflow_ui: ( new GUI )
     QT5 at least version 5.0.0 is required  or  Qt4 4.8.0 and above
     
* ecfFlow consists of two tar files i.e. :
   
   - boost_1_53_0.tar.gz
   - ecFlow-4.12.0-Source.tar.gz
   
* Create a directory for the build::

  > mkdir /tmp/ecflow_build
   
* Copy the the two tar file into this directory, then change directory to /tmp/ecflow_build
   
* Un-zip then un-tar the two file files::

  > tar -zxf boost_1_53_0.tar.gz
  > tar -zxf ecFlow-4.12.0-Source.tar.gz
   
* You should have two directories created::

   - boost_1_53_0
   - ecFlow-4.12.0-Source
    
* Create two environment variables. These are used by some of scripts::

  > export WK=/tmp/ecflow_build/ecFlow-4.12.0-Source
  > export BOOST_ROOT=/tmp/ecflow_build/boost_1_53_0
   
* ecflow uses bjam to build BOOST libraries and cmake to build ecflow
  
* To maintain compatibility between different releases of ecflow, you
  should use the same version of boost. If you do not care about this,
  then any boost version (> 1.53) should suffice. To use an existing
  boost release please ensure environment variable BOOST_ROOT is set

boost libs
=====================================================================
Use the following step to build boost from scratch:

* Boost uses bjam for building the boost libraries.  
  bjam source is available in boost, hence we first need to build bjam itself
  
  > cd $BOOST_ROOT
  > ./bootstrap.sh
  
  Now make sure bjam is accessible from $PATH

* Ecflow uses some of compiled libraries in boost. The following script
  will build the required lib's, in both debug and release forms
  and will configure boost build according to your platform
  
  > cd $BOOST_ROOT
  > $WK/build_scripts/boost_1_53_fix.sh    # fix for boost, only for some platforms
  > $WK/build_scripts/boost_build.sh       # compile boost libs used by ecFlow


cmake
=====================================================================
* By default will install /usr/local, hence may require root access rights
  > cd /tmp/ecflow_build/ecFlow-4.12.0-Source
  > mkdir build; cd build
  > cmake ..  
  > make -j2
  > make install
  > make test 


* Optionally you can specify install prefix directory:

  > cd /tmp/ecflow_build/ecFlow-4.12.0-Source
  > mkdir build; cd build
  > cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/var/tmp/$USER/install/cmake/ecflow 
  > make -j2
  > make install


* Optionally if you do *NOT* want to build the GUI(ecflowview) or UI(ecflow_ui) or Python api:

  > cd /tmp/ecflow_build/ecFlow-4.12.0-Source
  > mkdir build; cd build
  > cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/var/tmp/$USER/install/cmake/ecflow \
             -DENABLE_UI=OFF            \
             -DENABLE_PYTHON=OFF
  > make -j2
  > make install


* Optionally if you did not export BOOST_ROOT you can specify on the command line:

  > cd /tmp/ecflow_build/ecFlow-4.12.0-Source
  > mkdir build; cd build
  > cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/apps/ecflow \
             -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
             -DBOOST_ROOT=/tmp/ecflow_build/boost_1_53_0
  > make -j2
  > make install


* On some platforms(AIX) you may need to specify the c++ compiler

  > cd /tmp/ecflow_build/ecFlow-4.12.0-Source
  > mkdir build; cd build
  > cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/apps/ecflow \
             -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=xlC_r"
  > make -j2
  > make install


     
* To use the python_api, you need to add/change 
  PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  
      export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR
      
      
Ecflow uses Semantic versioning
