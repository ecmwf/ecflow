Compilation problems with: <boost_root>/libs/detail/utf8_codecvt_facet.cpp
==========================================================================

This needs to be fixed to boost versions:
    1.42:
    1.43:
    1.44: (not tested)
    1.45:

acc version 6 compiler problems with <boost_root>/libs/detail/utf8_codecvt_facet.cpp

Work around is to rewrite "get_cont_octet_out_count_impl"
ignoring the preprocessor directives (which are window specific anyway)
(see below). This needs to be done for each release as we dont know
what else has changed.

>>>>>>>>
For 1.42 can no longer build boost on HP-UX.
File-system, program-options and serialisation all show a similar
problem

The actual file <boost_root>/libs/detail/utf8_codecvt_facet.cpp
appears to have been changed in boost 1.40
for the function  get_cont_octet_out_count_impl

FROM:
// note the following code will generate on some platforms where
// wchar_t is defined as UCS2.  The warnings are superfluous as
// the specialization is never instantitiated with such compilers.
template<>
int get_cont_octet_out_count_impl<4>(wchar_t word){
    if (word < 0x80) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (word < 0x800) {
        return 1;
    }

    }
    if (word < 0x4000000) {
        return 4;

acc version 6 compiler problems with /boost/asio/detail/socket_ops.hpp 
==================================================================================================
**** This is required for all boost version < 1.45
**** Seem to have been fixed in boost 1.45

1/ The asio /boost/asio/detail/socket_ops.hpp (Line 643)
   make a reference to ::pselect which is not defined on HPUX 11.23
 
   In HP_UX 11.11,11.23  select() was defined in <sys/time.h>
   In HP-UX 11.31        select() was moved to <sys/select.h> and pselect() was introduced in the same file

   Hence boost/socket_ops.hpp needs a way of distinguishing OS versions.
   for the moment the work around may be to introduce a define like 011.31 | OS_IS_HPUX11_31

   // avi>> added ' && defined(OS_IS_HPUX11_31)'
   #if defined(__hpux) && defined(__HP_aCC) && defined(OS_IS_HPUX11_31)

   SO THAT WE CHOOSE select and NOT pselect

2/ additionally in 11.23 there are 2 ::select to choose:

  #include <sys/time.h>

      int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,
           fd_set *errorfds, struct timeval *timeout);
 
  For Backward Compatibility Only: (_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED not defined)

      #include <time.h>

      int select(size_t nfds, int *readfds, int *writefds,
           int *exceptds, const struct timeval *timeout);


  to get round the problem had to compile as:

     bjam define=_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

  to choose the right select
