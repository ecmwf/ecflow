Question to ask user & general support
=======================================

o Platform and compiler and boost version ?
  It may be compiler/boost version that we have not tested ?
   
o Version 

o Are they running on a virtual machine ?
  - Check size of VM for ecflow_server, see below about log file  ECFLOW-174

o Need the definition file.
  - Gives a que to the size of data transmitted for client/server communication.
  - We can use Pyext/test/TestBench.py to load to an existing/new server
    to test the customer defs.
  
o Log file
  - Will verify the server version
  - show server load, kind of requests, performance issues i.e news/sync
  - ** Look out for --log=get  in ecflow version < 4.0.6  **and** where the log file is huge.
    ** This is because the server read in the whole of the log file, and therefore consumed to much memory
    ** On virtual machines this may cause server to hang. 
    ** Ask user the VM taken up by the server
    ** ECFLOW-174
  - Watch out for --log=get <large number> this will have a same effect if <large number> > 1000000
  
o Ask user to supply info returned from:
  ecflow_client --port< > --host<> --stats
     Will verify server version and the total number of requests handled by the server
     Will also record the request handled in the last minute.
     
  ecflow_client --port< > --host<> --ping
  From the host/machine where they are running ecflowview
     See if there is any networking issue.
     Should vary between 1-65 milli second response for decent network response
     
     itanium    ->linix(11.3)  ~ 12-65 ms
     ecgate     ->linix(11.3)  ~  6-27 ms
     c1a        ->linux(11.3)  ~ 18-50 ms
     c2a        ->linux(11.3)  ~ 13-26 ms
     linux(10.3)->linux(11.3)  ~   1-7 ms
     linux(11.3)->linux(11.3)  ~   1-7 ms
     
     If it takes long, ask them to do:
        ping -R <host> 
        - Look for variation in ping times, along a given network path.
        - Look for number of pings on a network path getting no response
     This records the packet routing(network path) information, 
     and might indicate why its slow.
     
  
o If there is a performance problem::

  * First establish if its *consistent* and reproducible*
  	- Establish if they are using the right version of ecflowview.
      Post 3.1.0, we now put version in the ecflowview window title.
  	- Check ecflowview Poll rate, if this is excessive it can interfere with interactive use.
      i.e Edit->Preference, select "Server Options" tab
      Check "Call server every" <> seconds. If this is <15 seconds, it could explain
      slow interactive use.
  
  The following should be done *before* trying to reproduce the problem

  * If the using version < 4.0.6 and have large log files, check for '--log=get' in log file.
    This would have had an effect on the server, especially if running on VM.
  
  * In ecflowView, select the server, RMB->Extra->Client Logging on
    This will produce a file called:
       >> ecflow_client.log
    This will log the round trip time from the client ->server ->client
    for all user commands make by the GUI.
    Please send the file back.
    
    make sure they disable it afterwards, ie RMB->Extra->Client Logging off
     
  * Run strace;
    - ps -ef | grep ecflow_server   # not the pid
    - strace -p <pid> strace.txt 2>& 1
      *OR* strace -p <pid> -o tmp.txt
    
      This will record all the system level commands, there arguments and return values,
      additionally we can see the *size* in bytes of the client/server communication.
      watch out for sendmsg/recvmsg.
      Type CTRL Q, to stop recording, and send the file.
      
   * If server is stuck. 
     find process id of server:
     >> fstack <process-id>  # use fstack to dump the back trace of where it is stuck
     
   * can not connect, or server is dropping connection: ('Server::handle_read: End of file')
     Use netcat: on some systems may it is called nc:
     
     server side:
        > netcat -p <port> -l -v # -l list for inbound connection, -v verbose mode
        > netcat -p 3141   -l -v # use netcat to listen on port 3141, in verbose mode
        
     client side:
        > netcat <host> <port>
        > netcat ecflow-metab 3141
          > type a message this should be seen on the server side
