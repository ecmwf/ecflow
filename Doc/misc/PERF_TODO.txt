Testing Performance
==========================================================

o AParser/perf_aparser_timer  $SCRATCH/3199.def::
     This mimicks the download without the network, (but ignore compare)
     Times for Checkpt/restore/compare, 
 
o Client/bin/gcc-4.2.1/release/perf_test_large_defs 
   A real client server test on the local machine.
   Will delete,load,begin, sync, all the defs found in /var/tmp/ma0/BIG_DEFS/
   
o ecrcp -r /var/tmp/ma0/BIG_DEFS/ %REMOTE_HOST%:$ROOT_DIR/$ECFLOW/BIG_DEFS

o test job processing
  cd $WK ; cp /var/tmp/ma0/DEFS/metabuilder.def .
  Base/bin/gcc-5.3.0/release/perf_job_gen ./metabuilder.def
  

Log file<TODO>
================================================================
The log file, is automatically flushed for every write.
We could consider only flushing:
    o At the end of each command
    o NodeTreeObserver, CheckPt saver
This should cover all the cases.
Could also just flush on Log::ERR ?

To see the affect of buffering before/after run:

    strace -c Base/bin/gcc-5.3.0/release/perf_job_gen ./metabuilder.def
    
This will show the cost of the writes, and how much time is spent.


Trigger Parsing <TODO>
=================================================================
Currently use spirit classic for parsing trigger expressions:
Trigger expression parsing happens during:
   1/ Client side: for loading and check defs
   2/ Client Side: During replace command
   2/ Server side: During dependency evaluation.

Need to replace with spirit qi: for the following reason:
   1/ Spirit classic, is woefully slow, at run time
   2/ Will not be supported in the future. Need to replace with spirit qi
   3/ Add a lot of work arounds for performance problems:
      1/ Recognise the expression, if it has already be parsed , we store
         in a map, and clone the AST to avoid having to re-parse.
      2/ For very simple expressions, i.e "a == complete" we use simple parser.
   
I assume we can intermix the 2 spirit lib's, hence first step may be to use it
with the simplest expressions.
 

DISK IO
=====================================================================
   o/ print code: and minimise use of <<.
      In most cases this is used only due formatting of integers.
   o/ Each request, involve disk IO, ie writing to log file.
      ? Could buffer MSG, but warnings & errors, no buffering ?
      Could add another log category, hidden, so that commands
      are not buffered, only the affect, i.e. the state change
      messages are buffered.

Need a test case before starting.
   Test case will average of 10 check pts.
   Test case checkpt, interspersed with other requests, and time.
   (if check pt is made async' we should show significant performance
     improvement)      
   
   o/ Investigate use of memory mapped file for writing checkpt file.
      
   o/ Investigate asyncronous  disk IO for writing check point file

Thank you both for your insight. 
Minimizing the frequency of the << operator has had significant effects on 
how fast the text file is outputted. The convenience of the << operator << 
is useful in providing formatted text output, however, this apparently comes
with significant cost in the output time efficiency in large files. 

By formatting the text output myself into a string (acting as a buffer), 
and then moving the contents of the string to the file using the << operator, 
the output time dropped significantly from ~3.25min to ~1min for a 62MB file.
 Changing the size of the buffer (in lines) did not significantly increase the 
 output time of the file. In other words, by changing the amount of lines that 
 the string holds before dumping its content into the file did not affect the rate.

To determine the processing bottleneck that was taking place, 
I decided to forego the line formatting and see how fast it would take 
to output the same amount of lines consisting of a constant string. 
The answer: 7 seconds. So the next bottleneck has become my own text formatting code. 
At least it is significantly more efficient than formatting text using the << operator!

So my next endeavor will be to figure out a way to optimize my own text-formatting code. 
A good lesson here: Use << for small files for ease of output and coding; 
format the text yourself for large files and control over efficiency. 



Blocking IO
======================================================================
The log file shows that on systems with poor disk performance.
(i.e $SCRATCH ) that check pointing can block the server and 
interfere with job scheduling.

Should investigate check pointing on a separate thread.
May require a copy of defs(memory intensive) or mutex ?


   
Issues around reducing network load & improving browsing
==========================================================================
One bottleneck is the download of defs from the server.

o Create a bench mark test suite that measures the costs of
  full defs download from the server.  Use different sizes.

======================== TOO MUCH EFFORT ========================================================

Cacheing
==================================================================
Currently when ever a user request the full defs, the deserealisation
is cached. i.e if another user also request the full defs , we can just
return the string.
These could have been an oppertunity to also use/update the cache 
when check pointing. However there is small but significant difference
between the two.
  Check-pointing: Saves the edit history.
  Syncing       : No edit history.
  
Over time time the edit-history could be significant. This is download-able
as a separate command.

For release 4.4.0 -> 4.x.x
  Note: also when check pointing, we always save hidden children.
  i.e  when ecf::Flag::MIGRATED is set on suite/family.

  Hence check pointing has diverged from syncing.
  (The original thinking was if edit history issue could be resolved 
  there can be huge savings, for both syncing and check pointing. 
  Since the periodic check-pt would automatically update the cache, 
  like syncing would also update the cache.
  However the ecf::Flag::MIGRATED has thrown a spanner in the works.)

On reflection leave as is.)

(Note: cache is only updated when there is data model/defs tree change)


Return Nodes depending on the level
===========================================================================
  i.e level 0: Just return defs & server state
      level 1: return defs & suites only
      level 2: return defs & suite, and first suite children
      
   This can be done by, just modify NodeContainer serialisation.
   Each node has a level, this is compared with the requested level

Server comms, encode,protocol, outside of the message
===========================================================================

  This allows Portable binary archive to be used in conjunction
  with text archive. Could have HTML, in future.
  - Update command so that each request client->server 
    and each response server->client, encodes a protocol
  - Default to text/portable archive
  - Test on all platforms
  - Change connection.h to encode/decode the protocol.
  - Add portable binary archive. Recode exe size, Text size & performance changes
    (Make sure all platforms still cope, NOTE: the singleton cost is much higher)
  - AIX(TEXT), linux(TEXT & portable binary, must be able to choose)

Make all attributes children of Node
===========================================================================
  All derived from the same base class.
  Hence we only take hit for those attributes that are used.
  Too big a change ?????
  
Skeleton body/level
===========================================================================
  First request returns the skeleton
  Subsequent request return the body, but for
  a cut down node tree.
  Issues: how to handle changes ?
    
  Effort            : Large
  Application Effort: Large:
  Outcome: By commenting out all the serialisation of data members, ie For Suite,Family,Task,Submittable
           we can mimick a skeleton down load
           3199.def ~60 meg
                          Skeleton: load    ~9 seconds
                                   download ~3 seconds

Robert Ramey:
   But this begs the real question.  Do you want tracking or don't you.

   Without tracking -
      you won't be able to serialize apointer.
      and you'll missing the opptimization of space if the same object is
      serialized more than once.
      It will be faster to save and restore
   With tracking
      The opposite will be true

   So the decision to use tracking shouldn't made  as to the easiest way to fix
   the warning.
   The other way is to make the object we're saving non-const.
