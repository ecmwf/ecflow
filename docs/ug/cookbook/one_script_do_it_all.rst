One script Do It All
********************

Thanks to python syntax, provided there is no need to use include to
merge code, one single python script can be used on the command line,
but also as a task wrapper with no change, and it may provide the
ability to load the task into the expected server/suite for operation
and test.

Sweeper is used in operation to start product generation earlier.
