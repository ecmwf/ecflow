.. _ecflow_quickstart:

Quickstart
**********

This page gives a simple exercise that will allow you to create a very
simple ecFlow server, load it with a small suite of minimal tasks and
interact with it using the graphical user interface, :ref:`ecflow_ui`.

Once you have completed this, the :ref:`tutorial` is a
great way to gradually familiarise yourself with more details of ecFlow.

Create a directory to work in
=============================

The instructions here will assume we are working in the directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   mkdir -p $HOME/ecflow/quickstart
   cd $HOME/ecflow/quickstart
   
but any directory will do.

Download the example suite definition
=====================================

Click the following link to download the files needed to define our
sample suite:

`ecflow_quickstart.tar.gz <https://get.ecmwf.int/repository/test-data/ecflow/tutorial/ecflow_quickstart.tar.gz>`__

Or download directly from your terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

   wget https://sites.ecmwf.int/repository/ecflow/test-data/tutorial/ecflow_quickstart.tar.gz

Now, move it into your chosen working directory and untar it:

.. code-block:: shell

   tar xzvf ecflow_quickstart.tar.gz
   
Inspect and update the suite definition
=======================================

The file ``quickstart.def`` defines a suite called "quickstart". Open this file in a
text editor and note the structure.

.. code-block:: shell

   suite quickstart
      edit ECF_HOME "/replace/with/own/home/ecflow/quickstart"
      task t1
      task t2
         trigger t1 eq complete
   endsuite

We define a suite called "quickstart"; it defines a variable called ECF_HOME,
then it defines two tasks ("tasks" are things that actually run) and
specifies that task t2 will be run as soon as task t1 has completed. The
scripts corresponding to the tasks are specified in ".ecf" files in the
quickstart directory. Have a look - they simply print some information about
themselves, then sleep for 2 seconds.

**The first thing you must do** is to complete the path to your working
directory in the ECF_HOME definition in test.def and save the file.

Start an ecFlow server
======================

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: At ECMWF

        At ECMWF, each ecFlow server is set up to run on its own virtual machine (VM).
        See `HPC2020: Using ecFlow <http://https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/HPC2020%3A+Using+ecFlow>`__ for more
        details on setting up and using ecFlow at ECMWF.

        If attending a training course at ECMWF, you will liklely have an ecFlow server set up
        for you already, with host `ecfg-$USER-1` and port 3141.

        If you are running directly on the VDI (recommended), you will have the ecFlow client and UI
        commands available to you immediately. If your terminal is logged onto the HPC, you will
        first need to load the *ecflow* module:

        .. code-block:: shell

            module load ecflow

        From your terminal, check that you can communicate with your server. Note that 
        we do not need to specify ``--port=3141`` because that is the default port number.

        .. code-block:: shell

            ecflow_client --ping --host=ecfg-$USER-1
            ecflow_client --stats

       
       If that succeeds, then it would be a good idea to do the following in order to avoid
       adding ``--host`` to each command:

        .. code-block:: shell

            export ECF_HOST=ecfg-$USER-1

    .. tab:: Single Machine

       We will start a new running instance of an :term:`ecflow_server` using the
       default port, which is 3141. It is possible to use a different port by adding
       ``--port=3500`` (for example) to every ecFlow command-line action, or by setting
       the environment variable ECF_PORT to the desired port number. Note also
       that we start it as a background task - it will run until the server is
       stopped. It can be run in the foreground, but in that case you will need
       to use a new terminal for any subsequent commands!

       .. code-block:: shell

          ecflow_server &

       Check that it is running using the :term:`ecflow_client`:

       .. code-block:: shell

          ecflow_client --ping
          ecflow_client --stats

Load your suite definition into the server
==========================================

.. code-block:: shell

   ecflow_client --load=quickstart.def   

Check that it is loaded by asking the server to give you back the suite
definition:

.. code-block:: shell

   ecflow_client --get 

Monitor and interact via the GUI
================================

Start :ref:`ecflow_ui`:

.. code-block:: shell

    ecflow_ui &  
    
Once :ref:`ecflow_ui` has started, you must tell it how to reach your server. Go
to the Servers â†’ Manage Servers menu, click "Add server", then enter the
details of your server. **Name** can be anything you want - it's for you
to identify the server to your self; something like "myserver" would be
fine here. **Host** should in this case be either "localhost" in the case of running
on a single machine, or at ECMWF the name of your ecFlow server VM 
(e.g. "ecf-gen-<user>-1" where <user> is spelled out to your user id),
and **Port**
should be 3141 unless you changed it when starting the server. The other fields can be
left blank, but keep the "Add server to current view" box ticked.

You should now see your suite loaded into the GUI! Note that if some of the following
commands are not visible from the interface, you may need to tell ecFlowUI to change
to a more powerful mode: Tools->Preferences->Menu mode->Administrator. By default, some
high-level functions such as starting and stopping a server or a suite are not available.
This is by design, for your own safety!

If the server is not
currently active, right-click on the top-level node representing the server
and choose "Restart". Now right-click on the
"quickstart" node and choose "Begin" to make the suite active. The default
behaviour is to only refresh its view of the suite every 60 seconds, so
you will need to click the green refresh button at the top every so
often to see the progress of the tasks.

Note: if you need to make any changes to the suite definition (e.g. you forgot
to change the ECF_HOME variable), see the bottom of page :ref:`Loading the suite <tutorial-load-file>`
for instructions on how to reload an existing suite.
