   zombie_fail
   -----------
   
   Locates the task in the servers list of zombies, and sets to fail.
   Next time a child command (init,event,meter,label,abort,complete) which matches zombie, communicates with the server, will be set to fail.
   Depending on the job setup this may force a abort, the abort will also fail.
   Hence job structure should use 'set -e' in the error trapping functions to prevent
   infinite recursion.
   The references to the zombie in the server is automatically deleted after 1 hour
     args = list of task paths, at least one expected
     --zombie_fail=/path/to/task  /path/to/task2
