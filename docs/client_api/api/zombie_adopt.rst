   zombie_adopt
   ------------
   
   Locates the task in the servers list of zombies, and sets to adopt.
   Next time a child command (init,event,meter,label,abort,complete,wait queue) communicates with the server, the password on the zombie is adopted by the task.
   This is only allowed if the process id matches, otherwise an error is issued.
   The zombie reference stored in the server is then deleted.
     args = list of task paths, at least one expected
     --zombie_adopt=/path/to/task  /path/to/task2
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
