   Get,clear,flush or create a new log file.
   The user must ensure that a valid path is specified.
   Specifying '--log=get' with a large number of lines from the server,
   can consume a lot of **memory**. The log file can be a very large file,
   hence we use a default of 100 lines, optionally the number of lines can be specified.
    arg1 = [ get | clear | flush | new | path ]
     get -   Outputs the log file to standard out.
             defaults to return the last 100 lines
             The second argument can specify how many lines to return
     clear - Clear the log file of its contents.
     flush - Flush and close the log file. (only temporary) next time
             server writes to log, it will be opened again. Hence it best
             to halt the server first
     new -   Flush and close the existing log file, and start using the
             the path defined for ECF_LOG. By changing this variable
             a new log file path can be used
             Alternatively an explicit path can also be provided
             in which case ECF_LOG is also updated
     path -  Returns the path name to the existing log file
    arg2 = [ new_path | optional last n lines ]
            if get specified can specify lines to get. Value must be convertible to an integer
            Otherwise if arg1 is 'new' then the second argument must be a path
   Usage:
     --log=get                        # Write the last 100 lines of the log file to standard out
     --log=get 200                    # Write the last 200 lines of the log file to standard out
     --log=clear                      # Clear the log file. The log is now empty
     --log=flush                      # Flush and close log file, next request will re-open log file
     --log=new /path/to/new/log/file  # Close and flush log file, and create a new log file, updates ECF_LOG
     --log=new                        # Close and flush log file, and create a new log file using ECF_LOG variable
   
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
