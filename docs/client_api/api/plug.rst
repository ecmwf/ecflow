   plug
   ----
   
   Plug command is used to move nodes.
   The destination node can be on another server In which case the destination
   path should be of the form '<host>:<port>/suite/family/task
     arg1 = path to source node
     arg2 = path to the destination node
   This command can fail because:
   - Source node is in a 'active' or 'submitted' state
   - Another user already has an lock
   - source/destination paths do not exist on the corresponding servers
   - If the destination node path is empty, i.e. only host:port is specified,
     then the source node must correspond to a suite.
   - If the source node is added as a child, then its name must be unique
     amongst its peers
   Usage:
     --plug=/suite macX:3141  # move the suite to ecFlow server on host(macX) and port(3141)
   
   The client reads in the following environment variables. These are read by user and child command
   
   |----------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Name     |  Type    | Required   | Description                                                       |
   |----------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | ECF_HOST | <string> | Mandatory* | The host name of the main server. defaults to 'localhost'         |
   | ECF_PORT |  <int>   | Mandatory* | The TCP/IP port to call on the server. Must be unique to a server |
   | ECF_SSL  |  <any>   | Optional*  | Enable secure communication between client and server.            |
   |----------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
   
   * The host and port must be specified in order for the client to communicate with the server, this can 
     be done by setting ECF_HOST, ECF_PORT or by specifying --host=<host> --port=<int> on the command line
