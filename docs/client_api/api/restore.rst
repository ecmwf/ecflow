   restore
   -------
   
   Manually restore archived nodes.
   Restore will fail if:
     - Node has not been archived
     - Node has children, (since archived nodes have no children)
     - If the file ECF_HOME/<host>.<port>.<ECF_NAME>.check does not exist
   Nodes can be restored manually(as in this command) but also automatically
   
   Automatic restore is done using the 'autorestore' attribute.
   Once the node containing the 'autorestore' completes, the attribute is applied
   
    suite s
      family farchive_now
        autoarchive 0      # archive immediately after complete
        task tx
      endfamily
      family frestore_from_task
        task t1
           trigger ../farchive_now<flag>archived
           autorestore ../farchive_now  # call autorestore when t1 completes
      endfamily
    endsuite
   
   In this example task '/s/frestore_from_task/t1' is only triggered if 'farchive_now'
   is archived, then when t1 completes it will restore family 'farchive_now'
   Usage::
      --restore=/s1/f1   # restore family /s1/f1
      --restore=/s1 /s2  # restore suites /s1 and /s2
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
