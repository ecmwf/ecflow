   show
   ----
   
   Used to print state of the definition returned from the server to standard output.
   This command can *only* be used in a group command, and will only work if it is
   preceded with a get command. See examples below.
      arg1 = [ defs | state | migrate ] 
   The output of show has several options: i.e
     o no arguments: With no arguments, print the definition structure to standard output
       Extern's are automatically added, allowing the output to be reloaded into the server
       i.e --group="get ; show"
     o state:
       This will output definition structure along with all the state information.
       This will include the trigger expressions, abstract syntax tree as comments.
       Excludes the edit history
     o migrate:
       This will output definition structure along with all the state information.
       The node state is shown in the comments.
       This format allows the definition to be migrated to future version of ecflow.
       The output includes edit history but excludes externs.
       When the definition is reloaded *NO* checking is done.

   Usage:
       --group="get ; show"
       --group="get ; show defs"    # same as the previous example
       --group="get ; show state"   # Show all state for the node tree
       --group="get ; show migrate" # Shows state and allows migration
       --group="get=/s1; show"      # show state for the node only
       --group="get=/s1; show state"
