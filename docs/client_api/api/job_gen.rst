   -------
   
   Job submission for chosen Node *based* on dependencies.
   The server traverses the node tree every 60 seconds, and if the dependencies are free
   does job generation and submission. Sometimes the user may free time/date dependencies
   to avoid waiting for the server poll, this commands allows early job generation
     arg = node path | arg = NULL
        If no node path specified generates for full definition.
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
