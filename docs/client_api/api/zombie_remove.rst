   zombie_remove
   -------------
   
   Locates the task in the servers list of zombies, and removes it.
   Since a job typically has many child commands (i.e init, complete, event, meter, label, wait, queue)
   the zombie may reappear
     args = list of task paths, at least one expected
     --zombie_remove=/path/to/task  /path/to/task2
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
