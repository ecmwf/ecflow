   edit_script
   -----------
   
   Allows user to edit, pre-process and submit the script.
   Will allow pre-processing of arbitrary file with 'pre_process_file' option
    arg1 = path to task  # The path to the task/alias
    arg2 = [ edit | pre_process | submit | pre_process_file | submit_file ]
       edit : will return the script file to standard out. The script will
              include used variables enclosed between %comment/%end at the
              start of the file
       pre_process: Will return the script file to standard out.The script will
                    include used variables enclosed between %comment/%end at the
                    start of the file and with all %include expanded
       submit: Will extract the used variables from the supplied file, i.e
               between the %comment/%end and use these them to generate the
               job using the ecf file accessible from the server
       pre_process_file: Will pre process the user supplied file.
                         Will expand includes,variable substitution,
                         remove manual & comment sections.
       submit_file: Like submit, but the supplied file, is submitted by the server
                    The last 2 options allow complete freedom to debug the script file
    arg3 = [ path_to_script_file ]
             needed for option [  pre_process_file | submit_file ]
    arg4 = create_alias (optional) default value is false, for use with 'submit_file' option
    arg5 = no_run (optional) default value is false, i.e immediately run the alias
           is no_run is specified the alias in only created
   Usage:
   --edit_script=/path/to/task edit > script_file
      server returns script with the used variables to standard out
      The user can choose to edit this file
   
   --edit_script=/path/to/task pre_process > pre_processed_script_file
     server will pre process the ecf file accessible from the server
     (i.e expand all %includes) and return the file to standard out
   
   --edit_script=/path/to/task submit script_file
     Will extract the used variables in the 'script_file' and will uses these
     variables during variable substitution of the ecf file accessible by the
     server. This is then submitted as a job
   
   --edit_script=/path/to/task pre_process_file file_to_pre_process
     The server will pre-process the user supplied file and return the contents
     to standard out. This pre-processing is the same as job file processing,
     but on a arbitrary file
   
   --edit_script=/path/to/task submit_file file_to_submit
     Will extract the used variables in the 'file_to_submit' and will uses these
     variables during variable substitution, the file is then submitted for job
     generation by the server
   
   --edit_script=/path/to/task submit_file file_to_submit create_alias
     Like the the previous example but will create and run as an alias
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
