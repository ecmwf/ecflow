   load
   ----
   
   Check and load definition or checkpoint file into server.
   The loaded definition will be checked for valid trigger and complete expressions,
   additionally in-limit references to limits will be validated.
   If the server already has the 'suites' of the same name, then a error message is issued.
   The suite's can be overwritten if the force option is used.
   To just check the definition and not send to server, use 'check_only'
   This command can also be used to load a checkpoint file into the server
     arg1 = path to the definition file or checkpoint file
     arg2 = (optional) [ force | check_only | print | stats ]  # default = false for all
   Usage:
   --load=/my/home/exotic.def               # will error if suites of same name exists
   --load=/my/home/exotic.def force         # overwrite suite's of same name in the server
   --load=/my/home/exotic.def check_only    # Just check, don't send to server
   --load=/my/home/exotic.def stats         # Show defs statistics, don't send to server
   --load=host1.3141.check                  # Load checkpoint file to the server
   --load=host1.3141.check print            # print definition to standard out in defs format
