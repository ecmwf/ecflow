   order
   -----
   
   Re-orders the nodes held by the server
     arg1 = node path
     arg2 = [ top | bottom | alpha | order | up | down | runtime]
   It should be noted that in the absence of triggers and time/date dependencies,
   the tasks are submitted in order.
   This changes the order and hence affects the submission order::
   
      o top     raises the node within its parent, so that it is first
      o bottom  lowers the node within its parent, so that it is last
      o alpha   Arranges for all the peers of selected note to be sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)
      o order   Arranges for all the peers of selected note to be sorted in reverse alphabet(case-insensitive)
      o up      Moves the selected node up one place amongst its peers
      o down    Moves the selected node down one place amongst its peers
   
      o runtime Orders the nodes according to state change runtime
                for families by accumulated runtime of its children
                useful to submit the task that take longer earlier
   
   This command can fail because:
   - The node path does not exist in the server
   - The order_type is not does not match one of arg2
   Usage:
     --order=/suite/f1 top  # move node f1 to the top
   
   The client reads in the following environment variables. These are read by user and child command
   
   |----------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Name     |  Type    | Required   | Description                                                       |
   |----------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | ECF_HOST | <string> | Mandatory* | The host name of the main server. defaults to 'localhost'         |
   | ECF_PORT |  <int>   | Mandatory* | The TCP/IP port to call on the server. Must be unique to a server |
   | ECF_SSL  |  <any>   | Optional*  | Enable secure communication between client and server.            |
   |----------|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
   
   * The host and port must be specified in order for the client to communicate with the server, this can 
     be done by setting ECF_HOST, ECF_PORT or by specifying --host=<host> --port=<int> on the command line
