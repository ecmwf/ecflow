   order
   -----
   
   Re-orders the nodes held by the server
     arg1 = node path
     arg2 = [ top | bottom | alpha | order | up | down | runtime]
   It should be noted that in the absence of triggers and time/date dependencies,
   the tasks are submitted in order.
   This changes the order and hence affects the submission order::
   
      o top     raises the node within its parent, so that it is first
      o bottom  lowers the node within its parent, so that it is last
      o alpha   Arranges for all the peers of selected note to be sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)
      o order   Arranges for all the peers of selected note to be sorted in reverse alphabet(case-insensitive)
      o up      Moves the selected node up one place amongst its peers
      o down    Moves the selected node down one place amongst its peers
   
      o runtime Orders the nodes according to state change runtime
                for families by accumulated runtime of its children
                useful to submit the task that take longer earlier
   
   This command can fail because:
   - The node path does not exist in the server
   - The order_type is not does not match one of arg2
   Usage:
     --order=/suite/f1 top  # move node f1 to the top
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
