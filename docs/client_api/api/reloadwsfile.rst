   reloadwsfile
   ------------
   
   Reload the white list file.
   The white list file is used to authenticate 'user' commands.
   File path is specified by ECF_LISTS environment, read by the server on *startup*.
   Hence the contents of the file can be changed but not the location
   If ECF_LISTS is not specified, or is specified and is 'ecf.lists' then by default
   it will open <host>.<port>.ecf.lists.If a path like /var/tmp/ecf.lists was specified
   for ECF_LISTS, then this is the path used for reloading the white list file
   On startup, if the file is not present or is present but is empty (i.e just contains the version number)
   then all users have read/write access
   However on reload it will raises an error if file does not exist, or fails to parse
   Expected format for this file is:
   
   # comment
   4.4.14  # version number, this must be present, even if no users specified
   
   # Users with read/write access
   user1   # comment
   user2   # comment
   
   *       # use this form if you want all users to have read/write access
   
   # Users with read  access, must have - before user name
   -user3  # comment
   -user4
   
   -*      # use this form if you want all users to have read access
   
   The client considers, for both user and child commands, the following environment variables:
   
     ECF_HOST <string> [mandatory*]
       The main server hostname; default value is 'localhost'
     ECF_PORT <int> [mandatory*]
       The main server port; default value is '3141'
     ECF_SSL <any> [optional*]
       Enable secure communication between client and server.
     ECF_HOSTFILE <string> [optional]
       File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
     ECF_HOSTFILE_POLICY <string> [optional]
       The policy ('task' or 'all') to define which commands consider using alternate hosts.
   
   The options marked with (*) must be specified in order for the client to communicate
   with the server, either by setting the environment variables or by specifying the
   command line options.
