The CLI command **get** can be used to **show** the definition that is
loaded in the server.

Get all-suite node trees from the server and write to standard out.

.. code-block:: shell

  ecflow_client --get

This gets the suite "s1" from the server and writes to standard out. In
both of the examples, the output is fully parse-able

.. code-block:: shell

  ecflow_client --get=/s1  

To write the node tree **state** to standard output please use group
option, i.e.

.. code-block:: shell

  ecflow_client --get_state
  ecflow_client --get_state=/s1
