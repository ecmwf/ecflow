Going Further
*************

This section will present mechanisms to build more complex :term:`suites <suite>`
by introducing various ecFlow functionalities. More :term:`tasks <task>` will be introduced,
along with the facilities to group them into families.

Several mechanisms to define :term:`dependencies` between tasks will be introduced.

This section will also discuss how to use ecFlow to control when tasks run.
