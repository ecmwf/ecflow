Defining a new suite
====================

| There are several ways of defining the :term:`suite definition`.
| This tutorial will give examples for both the plain text and Python methods.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Text

      Text Method
      -----------

      Create a file called :file:`test.def`,using your favourite text editor, with the following contents:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :caption: $HOME/course/test.def

         suite test
            edit ECF_HOME "$HOME/course"  # replace '$HOME' with the path to your home directory
            task t1
         endsuite

      | This file contains the :term:`suite definition` of a :term:`suite` called test.
      | This suite contains a single :term:`task` called **t1**.
      | Let us go through the lines one by one:

      1. This line is a comment line. Any characters between the # and the end of line are ignored
      2. The second line is empty
      3. This line defines a new :term:`suite` by the name of test.
      4. Here we define a ecFlow :term:`variable` called ECF_HOME.
         This :term:`variable` defines the directory where all the unix files that will be used by the :term:`suite` test will reside.
         For the rest of the course all file names will be given relative to this directory.

         .. warning::

            Be sure to **replace** $HOME with the path to your home directory

      5. This defines a :term:`task` named **t1**
      6. The :token:`endsuite` finishes the definition of the :term:`suite` test


   .. tab:: Python

      Enter the following python code into a file, i.e :file:`test.py` :

      .. literalinclude:: src/defining-a-new_suite.py
         :language: python
         :caption: $HOME/course/test.py

      Then run as a python script:

      .. code-block:: shell

         python test.py

      Alternatively add the following as the first line in test.py:

      .. code-block:: python
         :caption:  $HOME/course/test.py

         #!/usr/bin/env python3
         ...

      .. code-block:: shell

         chmod +x test.py
         ./test.py  # this uses shebang, see below, searches for specified python variant in $PATH

      You should see the text "Creating suite definition" and then your definition as your output.


**What to do:**

#. Initially try both plain text and python examples. Later examples are only in python.
#. Type in the :term:`suite definition` file.  
#. Choose python invocation.  i.e. ``python3 test.py``  |  ``./test.py``.
