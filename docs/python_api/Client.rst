.. py:class:: Client
   :module: ecflow

   Bases: :py:class:`~Boost.Python.instance`

Class client provides an interface to communicate with the :term:`ecflow_server`.:

.. code-block:: shell

   Client(
      string host, # The server name. Cannot be empty.
      string port  # The port on the server, must be unique to the server
   )

   Client(
      string host, # The server name. Cannot be empty.
      int port     # The port on the server, must be unique to the server
   )

   Client(
      string host_port, # Expects <host>:<port> || <host>@<port>
   )

The client reads in the following environment variables.
For child commands,(i.e these are commands called in the .ecf/jobs files), these variables are used.
For the python interface these environment variable are not really applicable but documented for completeness:

* ECF_NAME <string> : Full path name to the task
* ECF_PASS <string> : The jobs password, allocated by server, then used by server to authenticate client request
* ECF_TRYNO <int>   : The number of times the job has run. Used in file name generation. Set to 1 by begin() and re-queue commands.
* ECF_TIMEOUT <int> : Max time in seconds for client to deliver message to main server
* ECF_HOSTFILE <string> : File that lists alternate hosts to try, if connection to main host fails
* ECF_DENIED <any> : Provides a way for child to exit with an error, if server denies connection. Avoids 24hr wait. Note: when you have hundreds of tasks, using this approach requires a lot of manual intervention to determine job status
* NO_ECF <any> : If set exit's immediately with success. Used to test jobs without communicating with server

The following environment variables are used by the python interface and child commands

* ECF_HOST  <string>   : The host name of the main server. defaults to 'localhost'
* ECF_PORT  <int>      : The TCP/IP port to call on the server. Must be unique to a server

The ECF_HOST and ECF_PORT can be overridden by using the Constructor or set_host_port() member function.
For optimal usage it is best to reuse the same Client rather than recreating for each client server interaction
By default the Client interface will throw exceptions for error's.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client('localhost:3150')   # for errors will throw RuntimeError
       ci.terminate_server()
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.alter( (Client)arg1, (list)paths, (str)alter_type, (str)attribute_type [, (str)name='' [, (str)value='']]) -> None :
   :module: ecflow

Alter command is used to change the attributes of a node
    ::
    
       void alter(
          (list | string ) paths(s) : A single or list of paths. Path name to the node whose attributes are to be changed
          string alter_type         : This must be one of [ 'add' | 'change' | 'delete' | 'set_flag' | 'clear_flag' ]
          string attr_type          : This varies according to the 'alter_type'. valid strings are:
             add    : [ variable,time,today,date,day,label,zombie,late]
             delete : [ variable,time,today,date,day,label,cron,event,meter,trigger,complete,repeat,limit,inlimit,limit_path,zombie,late]
             change : [ variable,clock-type,clock-gain,event,meter,label,trigger,complete,repeat,limit-max,limit-value,late,time,today]
             set_flag and clear_flag:
                      [ force_aborted | user_edit | task_aborted | edit_failed | ecfcmd_failed | statuscmd_failed | killcmd_failed |
                        no_script | killed | status | late | message | complete | queue_limit | task_waiting | locked | zombie ]
          string name               : used to locate the attribute, when multiple attributes of the same type,
                                      optional for some.i.e. when changing, attributes like variable,meter,event,label,limits
          string value              : Only used when 'changing' a attribute. provides a new value
       )
    
    Exceptions can be raised because:
    
    - absolute_node_path does not exist.
    - parsing fails
    
    The following describes the parameters in more detail:

.. py:method:: Client.archive( (Client)arg1, (str)arg2) -> None :
   :module: ecflow

Archives suite or family nodes. Saves the suite/family nodes to disk, and then removes then from the definition
    This saves memory in the server, when dealing with huge definitions that are not needed.
    If the node is re-queued or begun, it is automatically restored
    Use --restore to reload the archived nodes manually
    The nodes are saved to ECF_HOME/ECF_NAME.check

       string archive(
          list paths # List of paths.

Drop/de-register all handles associated with user.

When dealing with large definitions, where a user is only interested in a small subset
of suites, registering them, improves download performance from the server.
Registered suites have an associated handle.
Client must ensure un-used handle are dropped otherwise they will stay, in the :term:`ecflow_server`
::

   void ch_drop_user(

.. py:method:: Client.ch_handle( (Client)arg1) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Register interest in a set of :term:`suite`\ s.

If a definition has lots of suites, but the client is only interested in a small subset.
Then using this command can reduce network bandwidth and synchronisation will be quicker.
This command will create a client handle. This handle is held locally on the :py:class:`ecflow.Client`, and
can be used implicitly by ch_drop(),ch_add(),ch_remove() and ch_auto_add().
Registering a client handle affects the news() and sync() commands::

   void ch_register(
      bool auto_add_new_suites : true means add new suites to my list, when they are created
      list suite_names         : should be a list of suite names, names not in the definition are ignored
   )

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:

       suite_names = [ 's1', 's2', 's3' ]
       ci.ch_register(True,suite_names)    # register interest in suites s1,s2,s3 and any new suites
       ci.ch_register(False,suite_names)   # register interest in suites s1,s2,s3 only
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))

The client 'ci' will hold locally the client handle. Since we have made multiple calls to register
a handle, the variable 'ci' will hold the handle for the last call only.
The handle associated with the suite can be manually retrieved:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()
       ci.ch_register(True,['s1','s2','s3']) # register interest in suites s1,s2,s3 and any new suites
       client_handle = ci.ch_handle()        # get the handle associated with last call to ch_register
       ....                                  # after a period of time
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))
   finally:
       ci.ch_drop( client_handle )           # de-register the handle

To automatically drop the handle(preferred) use with:

After a call to sync_local() we can access the list of nodes that changed

The returned list consists of node paths. *IF* the list is empty assume that
whole definition changed. This should be expected after the first call to sync_local()
since that always retrieves the full definition from the server::

   :module: ecflow

Request the :term:`ecflow_server` :term:`check point`\ s the definition held in the server immediately

This effectively saves the definition held in the server to disk,
in a platform independent manner. This is the default when no arguments are specified.
The saved file will include node state, passwords, etc.
The default file name is <host>.<port>.ecf.check and is saved in ECF_HOME directory.
The :term:`check point` file name can be overridden via ECF_CHECK server environment variable.
The back up :term:`check point` file name can be overridden via ECF_CHECKOLD server environment variable::

   void checkpt(
     [(CheckPt::Mode)mode=CheckPt.UNDEFINED]
                         : Must be one of [ NEVER, ON_TIME, ALWAYS, UNDEFINED ]
                           NEVER  :  Never check point the definition in the server
                           ON_TIME:  Turn on automatic check pointing at interval stored on server
                                     or with interval specified as the second argument
                           ALWAYS:   Check point at any change in node tree, *NOT* recommended for large definitions
                           UNDEFINED:The default, which allows for immediate check pointing, or alarm setting
     [(int)interval=120] : This specifies the interval in seconds when server should automatically check pt.
                           This will only take effect if mode is on_time/CHECK_ON_TIME
                           Should ideally be a value greater than 60 seconds, default is 120 seconds
     [(int)alarm=30]     : Specifies check pt save alarm time. If saving the check pt takes longer than
                           the alarm time, then the late flag is set on the server.
                           This flag will need to be cleared manually.
   )

.. Note:: When the time taken to save the check pt is excessive, it can interfere with job scheduling.
          It may be an indication of the following:

          * slow disk
          * file system full
          * The definition is very large and needs to split

  2. export ECF_SSL=<host>.<port>  # Use server specific certificates <host>.<port>.***
  3. use --ssl           # argument on ecflow_client/ecflow_server, same as option 1.
                         # Typically ssl server can be started with ecflow_start.sh -s
  4. Client.enable_ssl() # for python client

ecFlow expects the certificates to be in directory $HOME/.ecflowrc/ssl
The certificates can be shared if you have multiple servers running on
the same machine. In this case use ECF_SSL=1, then
ecflow_server expects the following files in $HOME/.ecflowrc/ssl

   - dh2048.pem
   - server.crt
   - server.key
   - server.passwd (optional) if this exists it must contain the pass phrase used to create server.key

ecflow_client expects the following files in : $HOME/.ecflowrc/ssl

   - server.crt (this must be the same as server)

Alternatively you can have different setting for each server ECF_SSL=<host>.<port>
Then server expect files of the type:

   - <host>.<port>.pem
   - <host>.<port>.crt
   - <host>.<port>.key
   - <host>.<port>.passwd (optional)

and client expect files of the type:

   - <host>.<port>.crt  # as before this must be same as the server

The server/client will automatically check existence of both variants,
but will give preference to NON <host>.<port>.*** variants first, when ECF_SSL=1
The following steps, show you how to create the certificate files.
This may need to be adapted if you want to use <host>.<port>.***

- Generate a password protected private key. This will request a pass phrase.
  This key is a 1024 bit RSA key which is encrypted using Triple-DES and stored
  in a PEM format so that it is readable as ASCII text

     > openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024   # Password protected private key
- Additional security.
  If you want additional security, create a file called 'server.passwd' and add the pass phrase to the file.
  Then set the file permission so that file is only readable by the server process.
  Or you can choose to remove password requirement. In that case we don't need server.passwd file.

     > cp server.key server.key.secure
     > openssl rsa -in server.key.secure -out server.key  # remove password requirement
- Sign certificate with private key (self signed certificate).Generate Certificate Signing Request(CSR).
  This will prompt with a number of questions.
  However please ensure 'common name' matches the host where your server is going to run.

     > openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr # Generate Certificate Signing Request(CSR)
- Generate a self signed certificate CRT, by using the CSR and private key.

Force a node(s) to a given state
    
    When a :term:`task` is set to :term:`complete`, it may be automatically re-queued if it has
    multiple time :term:`dependencies`. In the specific case where a task has a single
    time dependency and we want to interactively set it to :term:`complete`
    a flag is set so that it is not automatically re-queued when set to complete.
    The flag is applied up the node hierarchy until reach a node with a :term:`repeat`
    or :term:`cron` attribute. This behaviour allow :term:`repeat` values to be incremented interactively.
    A :term:`repeat` attribute is incremented when all the child nodes are :term:`complete`
    in this case the child nodes are automatically re-queued

    Effect:
    
    Lets see the effect of forcing complete on the following defs

       suite s1
          task t1; time 10:00             # will complete straight away
          task t2; time 10:00 13:00 01:00 # will re-queue 3 times and complete on fourth 
    
    In the last case (task t2) after each force complete, the next time slot is incremented.
    This can be seen by calling the Why command.

.. py:method:: Client.get_defs( (Client)arg1) -> Defs :
   :module: ecflow

Returns the :term:`suite definition` stored on the Client.

Use :py:class:`ecflow.Client.sync_local()` to retrieve the definition from the server first.
The definition is *retained* in memory until the next call to sync_local().

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()         # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.sync_local()       # get the definition from the server and store on 'ci'
       print(ci.get_defs())  # print out definition stored in the client
       print(ci.get_defs())  # print again, this shows that defs is retained on ci

   :module: ecflow

The File command is used to request the various file types associated with a :term:`node`.

By default, the output is composed of the last 10000 lines of the file. The number of lines can be customised via the :code:`max_lines` parameter.

The content can be retrieved as a sequence of 'bytes'. This allows to download a file that contains invalid Unicode sequence, without causing an :code:`UnicodeDecodeError` to be raised.
::

   string get_file(
      string absolute_node_path    : Path name to node
      [(string)file_type='script'] : file_type = [ script<default> | job | jobout | manual | kill | stat ]
      [(string)max_lines='10000'] : The number of lines in the file to return
      [(bool)as_bytes=False] : A flag indicating if the output should be 'bytes'; by default the output is of type 'str'
   )

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()        # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       for file in [ 'script', 'job', 'jobout', 'manual', 'kill', 'stat' ]:
           print(ci.get_file('/suite/f1/t1',file))  # print the contents of the file
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.get_host( (Client)arg1) -> str :
   :module: ecflow

Return the host, assume set_host_port() has been set, otherwise return localhost


.. py:method:: Client.get_log( (Client)arg1, (int)arg2) -> str :
   :module: ecflow

Request the :term:`ecflow_server` to return the log file contents as a string

Use with caution as the returned string could be several megabytes.
Only enabled in the debug build of ECF.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()          # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       print(ci.get_log(100)  # get the 100 last lines from server log file
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.get_port( (Client)arg1) -> str :
   :module: ecflow

Return the port, assume set_host_port() has been set. otherwise returns 3141


.. py:method:: Client.get_server_defs( (Client)arg1) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Get all suite Node tree's from the :term:`ecflow_server`.

The definition is *retained* in memory until the next call to get_server_defs().
This is important since get_server_defs() could return several megabytes of data.
Hence we only want to call it once, and then access it locally with get_defs().
If you need to access the server definition in a loop use :py:class:`ecflow.Client.sync_local` instead
since this is capable of returning incremental changes, and thus considerably
reducing the network load.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()         # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.get_server_defs()  # get the definition from the server and store on 'ci'
       print(ci.get_defs())  # print out definition stored in the client
       print(ci.get_defs())  # print again, this shows that defs is retained on ci
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.group( (Client)arg1, (str)arg2) -> int :

   )

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()               # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.group('get; show')

.. py:method:: Client.halt_server( (Client)arg1) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Halt the :term:`ecflow_server`

Stop server communication with jobs, and new job scheduling, and stops check pointing.
See :term:`server states`

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()            # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.halt_server()
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.in_sync( (Client)arg1) -> bool :
   :module: ecflow

Returns true if the definition on the client is in sync with the :term:`ecflow_server`

.. Warning:: Calling in_sync() is **only** valid after a call to sync_local().

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
      ci = Client()                       # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
      ci.sync_local()                     # very first call gets the full Defs
      client_defs = ci.get_defs()         # End user access to the returned Defs
      ... after a period of time
      ci.sync_local()                     # Subsequent calls to sync_local() users the local Defs to sync incrementally
      if ci.in_sync():                    # returns true  changed and changes applied to client
         print('Client is now in sync with server')
      client_defs = ci.get_defs()         # End user access to the returned Defs
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.is_auto_sync_enabled( (Client)arg1) -> bool :
   :module: ecflow

Returns true if automatic syncing enabled


.. py:method:: Client.job_generation( (Client)arg1, (str)arg2) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Job submission for chosen Node *based* on :term:`dependencies`

The :term:`ecflow_server` traverses the :term:`node` tree every 60 seconds, and if the dependencies are free
does `job creation` and submission. Sometimes the user may free time/date dependencies
to avoid waiting for the server poll, this commands allows early job generation
::

   void job_generation(
      string absolute_node_path: Path name for job generation to start from
   )
   If empty string specified generates for full definition.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()    # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.job_generation('/s1')  # generate jobs for suite '/s1 
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.kill( (Client)arg1, (str)arg2) -> None :
   :module: ecflow

Kills the job associated with the :term:`node`
    ::
    
       void kill(
          list paths: List of paths. Paths must begin with a leading '/' character
       )
       void kill(
          string absolute_node_path: Path name to node to kill.
       )
    
    If a :term:`family` or :term:`suite` is selected, will kill hierarchically.
    Kill uses the ECF_KILL_CMD variable. After :term:`variable substitution` it is invoked as a command.
    The ECF_KILL_CMD variable should be written in such a way that the output is written to %ECF_JOB%.kill, i.e:
    
    .. code-block:: shell
    
       kill -15 %ECF_RID% > %ECF_JOB%.kill 2>&1
       /home/ma/emos/bin/ecfkill %USER% %HOST% %ECF_RID% %ECF_JOB% > %ECF_JOB%.kill 2>&1
    
    
    Exceptions can be raised because:
    
    - The absolute_node_path does not exist in the server
    - ECF_KILL_CMD variable is not defined
    - :term:`variable substitution` fails
    
    Usage:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
       try:

           time.sleep(2)
           print(ci.file('/s1/t1','kill')) # request kill output

       )
    
    By default throws a RuntimeError exception for errors.
    If force is not used and :term:`suite` of the same name already exists in the server,
    then a error is thrown

   :module: ecflow

Request the :term:`ecflow_server` to use the path provided, as the new log file

The old log file is released.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()               # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.new_log('/path/log.log') # use '/path/log,log' as the new log file

.. py:method:: Client.news_local( (Client)arg1) -> bool :
   :module: ecflow

Query the :term:`ecflow_server` to detect any changes.

This returns a simple bool, if there has been changes, the user should call :py:class:`ecflow.Client.sync_local`.
This will bring the client in sync with changes in the server. If sync_local() is not called
then calling news_local() will always return true.
news_local() uses the definition stored on the client::

   bool news_local()


Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()                  # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       if ci.news_local():            # has the server changed
          print('Server Changed')     # server changed bring client in sync with server
          ci.sync_local()             # get the full definition from the server if first time
                                      # otherwise apply incremental changes to Client definition,
                                      # bringing it in sync with the server definition
          print(ci.get_defs())        # print the synchronised definition. Should be same as server
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.order( (Client)arg1, (str)arg2, (str)arg3) -> None :
   :module: ecflow

Re-orders the :term:`node`\ s in the :term:`suite definition` held by the :term:`ecflow_server`

It should be noted that in the absence of :term:`dependencies`,
the order in which :term:`task`\ s are :term:`submitted`, depends on the order in the definition.
This changes the order and hence affects the submission order
::

   void order(
      string absolute_node_path: Path name to node.
      string order_type        : Must be one of [ top | bottom | alpha | order | up | down ]
   )
   o top     raises the node within its parent, so that it is first
   o bottom  lowers the node within its parent, so that it is last
   o alpha   Arranges for all the peers of selected note to be sorted alphabetically
   o order   Arranges for all the peers of selected note to be sorted in reverse alphabet
   o up      Moves the selected node up one place amongst its peers
   o down    Moves the selected node down one place amongst its peers

Exceptions can be raised because:

- The absolute_node_path does not exist in the server
- The order_type is not the right type

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()   # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.order('/s1/f1','top')
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.ping( (Client)arg1) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Checks if the :term:`ecflow_server` is running
::

   void ping()

The default behaviour is to check on host 'localhost' and port 3141
It should be noted that any Client function will fail if the server is
is not running. Hence ping() is not strictly required. However its main
distinction from other Client function is that it is quite fast.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client('localhost','3150')
       ci.ping()
       print('------- Server already running------')
       do_something_with_server(ci)

       print('------- Server *NOT* running------' + str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.plug( (Client)arg1, (str)arg2, (str)arg3) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Plug command is used to move :term:`node`\ s

The destination node can be on another :term:`ecflow_server`.
In which case the destination path should be of the form '//<host>:<port>/suite/family/task
::

By default throws a RuntimeError exception for errors.

Exceptions can be raised because:

- Source :term:`node` is in a :term:`active` or :term:`submitted` state.
- Another user already has an lock.
- source/destination paths do not exist on the corresponding servers
- If the destination node path is empty, i.e. only host:port is specified,
  then the source :term:`node` must correspond to a :term:`suite`.
- If the source node is added as a child, then its name must be unique

Usage:

Query the status of event, meter, state, variable, limit, limit_max or trigger expression without blocking

 - state     return [unknown | complete | queued |             aborted | submitted | active] to standard out
 - dstate    return [unknown | complete | queued | suspended | aborted | submitted | active] to standard out
 - event     return 'set' | 'clear' to standard out
 - meter     return value of the meter to standard out
 - limit     return value of the limit to standard out
 - limit_max return max value of the limit to standard out
 - variable  return value to standard out
 - trigger   returns 'true' if the expression is true, otherwise 'false'

  )

By default throws a exception for errors.

Exceptions can be raised if the path to the attribute does not exist and because:

- No event of the given name exists on the specified node
- No meter of the given name exists on the specified node
- No limit of the given name exists on the specified node
- No variable of the given name (repeat or generated variable) exists on the
  specified node or any of its parent
- trigger expression does not parse, or if references to node/attributes are not defined

    Exceptions can be raised because:
    
    - The absolute_node_path does not exist in the provided definition
    - The provided client definition must be free of errors
    - If the third argument is not provided, then the absolute_node_path must exist in the server defs
    - replace will fail, if child task nodes are in :term:`active` / :term:`submitted` state
    
    After replace is done, we check trigger expressions. These are reported to standard output.
    It is up to the user to correct invalid trigger expressions, otherwise the tasks will *not* run.
    Please note, you can use check() to check trigger expression and limits in the server.

    When a job completes, it may be automatically re-queued if it has
    multiple time :term:`dependencies`. In the specific case where a :term:`task` has a SINGLE
    time dependency and we want to avoid re running the :term:`task` then

    The flag is applied up the :term:`node` hierarchy until we reach a node with a :term:`repeat`
    or :term:`cron` attribute. This behaviour allow :term:`repeat` values to be incremented interactively.
    A :term:`repeat` attribute is incremented when all the child nodes are :term:`complete`

    The command should be written in such a way that the output is written to %ECF_JOB%.stat, i.e:
    
    .. code-block:: shell
    
       /home/ma/emos/bin/ecfstatus  %USER% %HOST% %ECF_RID% %ECF_JOB% > %ECF_JOB%.stat 2>&1
    
    Exceptions can be raised because:
    
    - The absolute_node_path does not exist in the server
    - ECF_STATUS_CMD variable is not defined
    - :term:`variable substitution` fails
    
    Usage:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
       try:
           ci = Client()    # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
           ci.status('/s1/t1')
           time.sleep(2)
           print(ci.file('/s1/t1','stats')) # request status output
       except RuntimeError, e:
           print(str(e))
    

status( (Client)arg1, (list)arg2) -> None


.. py:method:: Client.suites( (Client)arg1) -> list :
   :module: ecflow

Returns a list strings representing the :term:`suite` names
::

   list(string) suites()

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()  # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       suites = ci.suites()
       print(suites)
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.suspend( (Client)arg1, (str)arg2) -> None :
   :module: ecflow

Suspend `job creation` / generation for the given :term:`node`
    ::
    
       void suspend(
          list paths: List of paths. Paths must begin with a leading '/' character
       )
       void suspend(
          string absolute_node_path: Path name to node to suspend.
       )
    
    Usage:
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
       try:
           ci = Client()    # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
           ci.suspend('/s1/f1/task1')
           paths = ['/s1/f1/t1','/s2/f1/t2']
           ci.suspend(paths)
       except RuntimeError, e:
           print(str(e))
    

suspend( (Client)arg1, (list)arg2) -> None


.. py:method:: Client.sync_local( (Client)arg1 [, (bool)sync_suite_clock=False]) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Requests that :term:`ecflow_server` returns the full definition or incremental change made and applies them to the client Defs

When there is a very large definition, calling :py:class:`ecflow.Client.get_server_defs` each time can be *very* expensive
both in terms of memory, speed, and network bandwidth. The alternative is to call
this function, which will get the incremental changes, and apply them local client :term:`suite definition`
effectively synchronising the client and server Defs.
If the period of time between two sync() calls is too long, then the full server definition
is returned and assigned to the client Defs.
We can determine if the changes were applied by calling in_sync() after the call to sync_local()::

   void sync_local();                     # The very first call, will get the full Defs.


Exceptions:

- raise a RuntimeError if the delta change cannot be applied.
- this could happen if the client Defs bears no resemblance to server Defs

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()                       # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.sync_local()                     # Very first call gets the full Defs
       client_defs = ci.get_defs()         # End user access to the returned Defs
       ... after a period of time
       ci.sync_local()                     # Subsequent calls to sync_local() users the local Defs to sync incrementally
       if ci.in_sync():                    # returns true server changed and changes applied to client
          print('Client is now in sync with server')
       client_defs = ci.get_defs()         # End user access to the returned Defs
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))

Calling sync_local() is considerably faster than calling get_server_defs() for large Definitions


.. py:method:: Client.terminate_server( (Client)arg1) -> int :
   :module: ecflow

Terminate the :term:`ecflow_server`


Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       ci = Client()            # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
       ci.terminate_server()
   except RuntimeError, e:
       print(str(e))


.. py:method:: Client.version( (Client)arg1) -> str :
   :module: ecflow

Returns the current client version


.. py:method:: Client.wait_for_server_reply( (Client)arg1 [, (int)time_out=60]) -> bool :
   :module: ecflow

Wait for a response from the :term:`ecflow_server`::

   void wait_for_server_reply(
      int time_out     : (default = 60) 
   )

This is used to check if server has started. Typically for tests.
Returns true if server(ping) replies before time out, otherwise false

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   ci = Client()   # use default host(ECF_HOST) & port(ECF_PORT)
   if ci.wait_for_server_reply(30):
      print('Server is alive')
   else:
      print('Timed out after 30 second wait for server response.?')
